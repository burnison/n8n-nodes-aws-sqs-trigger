# n8n-nodes-aws-sqs-trigger

This repo contains example nodes to help you get started building your own custom integrations for [n8n](n8n.io). It includes the node linter and other dependencies.

To make your custom node available to the community, you must create it as an npm package, and [submit it to the npm registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry).

## How to install

### Community Nodes (Recommended)

For users on n8n v0.187+, your instance owner can install this node from [Community Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/).

1. Go to **Settings > Community Nodes**.
2. Select **Install**.
3. Enter `@mkay/n8n-nodes-aws-sqs-trigger` in **Enter npm package name**.
4. Agree to the [risks](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/risks/) of using community nodes: select **I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source**.
5. Select **Install**.

After installing the node, you can use it like any other node. n8n displays the node in search results in the **Nodes** panel.

### Manual installation
To get started install the package in your n8n root directory:

`npm install @mkay/n8n-nodes-aws-sqs-trigger`

For Docker-based deployments, add the following line before the font installation command in your [n8n Dockerfile](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/docker/images/n8n/Dockerfile):

`RUN cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/n8n && npm install @mkay/n8n-nodes-aws-sqs-trigger`
